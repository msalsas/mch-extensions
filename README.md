## MyCryptoHeroes extensions app

This project aims to help to look up for MCH extensions filtering by rarity and ordering by attributes.

- All extensions are stored with `indexedDB` (front-end side) by clicking on *"Load All"* button (Unique extensions tab). It can take some hours.
- Then you can filter/order all unique extensions.
- You need to be connected to Ethereum with Metamask or any other Ethereum wallet.

*[My Crypto Heroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/) is an RPG battle game that is built on the Ethereum blockchain.
